# FINERY
A mock-up e-commerce storefront built with React and Redux

## About
FINERY is a mock-up e-commerce storefront I built to learn and practice using Redux. The state manager tool was used mainly for the cart component; users can add or remove items from the cart and update their quantity, which automatically re-calculates the subtotal at checkout. The UI and design of the web is original, but I owe all shopping items to one of my favorite stores, Everlane!

## Stack
- React and Material UI for the front-end
- Redux and Redux Persist for managing states
