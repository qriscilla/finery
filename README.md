#FINERY

##About
FINERY is a mock-up e-commerce storefront I built to learn and practice using Redux. The state manager was used mainly for the cart component; users can add or remove items from the cart and update their quantity, automatically updating the subtotal at checkout. The UI and design of the web is original, but I owe all shopping items to one of my favorite stores, Everlane!
